# Data Analysis Project üöÄ

Welcome to the Data Analysis Project repository! This project focuses on analyzing gas charges data using Python, leveraging various data manipulation, visualization, and predictive modeling techniques.

## Overview üìã
This repository contains Python scripts designed to analyze gas charges data from an Excel file (`DATA_SET_1.xlsx`). The scripts utilize libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn to perform data loading, aggregation, filtering, and visualization tasks. 

## Features ‚ú®
- **Data Loading and Overview**: Load the dataset and view its structure.
- **Monthly Totals**: Calculate and visualize gas charges and meter rent totals grouped by billing month.
- **Customer Class Analysis**: Analyze gas charges and meter rent totals grouped by customer class.
- **Interactive Filtering**: Prompt users to filter data by billing month and optional customer class, displaying relevant columns.
- **Visualization**: Visualize monthly gas charges using bar charts, pie charts for distribution, and line plots for trends over time.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Use linear regression and gradient boosting regression to predict future gas charges.

## Getting Started üèÅ
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using: git clone https://github.com/ahmedmusharaf31/Data_Analysis.git
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed. Install required libraries: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn 
3. **Run the Scripts**: Execute Python scripts to load data, perform analyses, and visualize results.

## Usage üîß
- Modify paths and data sources as needed (`DATA_SET_1.xlsx`).
- Adjust analysis parameters and visualization styles in the scripts.
- Explore different predictive models or add new functionalities based on project requirements.
