# 📊 Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the Data Analysis Project!
This repository showcases Python scripts for analyzing gas charges data from an Excel file (`DATA_SET_1.xlsx`). 
It includes functionalities to load data, perform data aggregation by billing month and customer class, filter data based on user input, and visualize trends using bar charts, pie charts, and line plots. 
The project utilizes popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn for data manipulation, visualization, and predictive modeling. Explore various analysis techniques such as linear regression and gradient boosting regression for predicting future gas charges. Dive into the code, run the scripts, and visualize insights to gain a deeper understanding of gas consumption trends over time.
